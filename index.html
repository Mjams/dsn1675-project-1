  <h2 id="me" class="about">About Me</h2>

<p>My name is Maggie Paquette. I am a Graphic Design student at Algonquin College in Ottawa Ontario. I am hard working and dedicated to make every piece of art the best I possibly can. Straight out of high school I knew Graphic Design was for me. Any way that I can use my artistic passion into something I could do for a living would make me happy. I have been interested in art since I was knee high to a grasshopper. I never thought I would be able to pursue career path that would involve me using my artistic and creative skills, but now I have and I couldn’t be more content.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you a little more about me. I work in a bakery, I wish I could take credit for being the primary cake maker, but I sadly am not. When I finish my duties I will make and decorate cakes and cupcakes, I started out with the basics, but I love creating ones with crazy colours, flavours and designs. I do some small freelance projects for local companies. Some involving designing T-shirts through local t-shirt printing company.</p>
